# redpoint

measuring climber performance

### what is it

redpoint is a data acquisition device that clips onto a climbers harness that measures and records rock climber performance using an altimeter and an accelerometer. 


### how does it work
once redpoint is powered on, it will start measuring altitude and automatically detect the beginning of a new ascent. 

as the climber ascends, redpoint will record the climb time, altitude, and information about forces experienced during any falls.

when the climber is lowered, redpoint will detect the completion of a route and stop logging. 

the device will sync over bluetooth with a climber's phone, where the information can be reviewed and the climb can be annotated.

redpoint will be rechargable via a micro USB connector
